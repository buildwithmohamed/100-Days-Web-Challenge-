# 👥 Responsive Team Card Component

Welcome to **Day 01** of my [100 Days of HTML/CSS/JS Challenge](https://github.com/BuildwithMohamed/100-Days-Web-Challenge)!

This project is a **responsive team member card layout** designed with a strong emphasis on:

- ✨ CSS **pseudo-classes** (`:hover`, `:nth-child`, etc.)
- 🎨 CSS **pseudo-elements** (`::before`, `::after`)
- 📱 **Viewport-based units** for responsive typography and spacing
- 📷 **Flexbox image sizing** to ensure layout stability across breakpoints

---

## 🔍 Features

- Fully responsive layout using **Flexbox**
- Profile cards resize fluidly with **`vw` and `vh`** units
- Image containers maintain aspect ratios using `object-fit`
- Hover effects styled with **`:hover` pseudo-classes**
- Subtle UI flair added using `::before` and `::after`
- Clean, accessible HTML structure

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to style elements dynamically with **pseudo-classes**
- How to create decorative effects with **pseudo-elements**
- The impact of **viewport units** (`vw`, `vh`) on layout responsiveness
- How **flex-grow**, `flex-basis`, and `object-fit` work together to size and align team member cards and also in this Project i understood how to use aspect-ratio for image sizing.
- I learned to Avoid Global Padding on * Selector. 
    Why it's a problem: Adds unintended spacing everywhere (e.g., <button>, <input>).
- Improved my understanding of **mobile-first CSS architecture**

## 🧠 What I Could  Improve in this Project
1. 💡 Use CSS Variables for Reusability

:root {
  --primary-font: "DM Sans", sans-serif;
  --text-color: #707172;
  --box-shadow: 0px 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
