# 💯 100 Days of HTML, CSS & JavaScript

Welcome to the **100 Days of Web Development Challenge** by [BuildwithMohamed](https://github.com/BuildwithMohamed)! 🚀  
I'm Mohamed, and I'm committing to building **100 mini projects** using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. No frameworks, just fundamentals — crafted to be helpful, reusable, and open source.

> 🎯 Goal: Sharpen front-end skills, build a solid portfolio, and help others learn through practical, bite-sized code challenges.
